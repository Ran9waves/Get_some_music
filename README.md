<h3>About the project...</h3>
<p>This project was created with the aim of having fun and testing my python knowledge.</p>

<h3>Important</h3>
<p>Do not forget to install the libraries indicated on the file (pydub, pytube...)</p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>
<p>This python program works in the following way: </p>

<p>1- Requests you to indicate the link of the song that you want to download. </p>
<p>2- After introducing it, it will be downloaded </p>
<p>3- Then converted to mp3 </p>
<p>4- Finally you will be asked if you want to iterate the process. In case you indicate "yes" the process will be iterated, else the programm will be stopped. </p>
